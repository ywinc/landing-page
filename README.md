BVT Description:


You may use CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, or Bootstrap Grid.
You may also use customized media queries.


Your page should look good on Mobile vertical scroll as well as full-screen desktop (1920 X 1080).

Similar to the Login UI Project and the Email Template Project, all you guys have to do is recreate this product landing page, there doesn't have to be any functionality to it. 
You can pick whatever product you want (as long as it's mostly appropriate) and you can choose to do it all with vanilla CSS, Bootstrap, or with another CSS library like Materialize (but generally speaking you only need to use one library).

If you do not like the Freecodecamp.org design requirements, you are free to use any other reference pages or photos for your design of your product landing page.
